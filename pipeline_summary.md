# Customer Propensity ML Pipeline - Summary

## Overview

This comprehensive machine learning pipeline predicts customer propensity to purchase based on website interaction data. The pipeline handles severe class imbalance (4.19% positive rate) and implements advanced feature engineering with multiple model comparisons.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Processing
- **Training Data**: 455,401 samples with 23 binary features
- **Test Data**: 151,655 samples
- **Target**: Binary 'ordered' variable (severely imbalanced: 95.81% negative, 4.19% positive)

### 2. Feature Engineering
Custom `InteractionFeatureTransformer` creates:
- **Interaction Features**: Between high-impact variables (sign_in × saw_checkout, basket actions)
- **Engagement Score**: Sum of user engagement indicators
- **Intent Score**: Sum of checkout-related actions
- **Device Interactions**: Device type × returning user patterns

### 3. Class Imbalance Handling
- **Primary Approach**: Class weights ('balanced') for all models
- **Alternative**: SMOTE oversampling (attempted but had pipeline compatibility issues)
- **Scale Adjustment**: XGBoost uses calculated scale_pos_weight

### 4. Model Training & Evaluation

#### Models Implemented:
1. **Logistic Regression** (baseline with class weights)
2. **Random Forest** (with class weights)  
3. **XGBoost** (with scale_pos_weight)

#### Cross-Validation:
- 3-fold Stratified CV for hyperparameter tuning
- Grid search optimization targeting F1 score
- 80/20 stratified train/validation split

# Engagement Rates — Analyst Insights (Conversational)

This summarizes what the `engagement_rates.png` chart tells us and what to do next.

## What stands out
- **UK audience dominates (~93%)**: We’re effectively UK‑first. Default shipping, copy, promos to UK expectations.
- **Mobile is the main storefront (~68%)**: Mobile UX and speed will drive most of the upside.
- **Returning users are over half (~54%)**: People come back. Remarketing and “pick up where you left off” matter.
- **Homepage is busy (~29%)**: It’s the launchpad — guide quickly to product/cart/checkout.
- **Size selection is common (~23%)**: Fit confidence is a lever. Clearer size guidance can lift add‑to‑cart and reduce returns.

## Purchase‑intent signals (mid‑tier rates)
- **Add to basket (detail ~11.3%, icon ~9.9%)**: Keep add‑to‑cart prominent and sticky on mobile.
- **Sign in (~8.9%)**: Allow guest checkout; invite account creation after purchase.
- **Checkout (~8.0%)**: Shorten the steps; remove distractions.
- **Delivery info (~6.3%)**: Show cost/ETA earlier (PDP/cart) to avoid surprises.

## Low‑engagement items (today’s low impact)
- **Sort/filter, image picker, promo banners, returns, account upgrade, size charts (<~4%)**: Likely low visibility or low persuasion. Simplify or repurpose space.

## Recommended moves (prioritized)
1. **Mobile first**: speed budgets, larger tap targets, sticky CTAs, one‑handed flows.
2. **Shorten the funnel**: homepage → PDP → cart → checkout with fewer clicks.
3. **Boost intent moments**: sticky add‑to‑cart, guest checkout, early shipping clarity.
4. **Returning user nudges**: restore carts, recent views, targeted offers.
5. **Fit confidence**: clearer size help/fit notes; test on top‑traffic PDPs.

## Experiments to run next
- Sticky vs non‑sticky add‑to‑cart on mobile PDP (A/B).
- Show shipping estimate on PDP vs only at cart (A/B).
- Guest checkout default vs login‑first (A/B).
- Size tips module vs current size chart link (A/B).

## Metrics to watch
- Add‑to‑cart rate, checkout reach rate, mobile conversion rate, returning user conversion, PDP/cart bounce.

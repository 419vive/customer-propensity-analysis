# Streamlined Marketing Workflow Outline (No BS)

## The Business Problem (Non-Technical Context)
**Imagine**: You run a website and get 1,000 visitors daily. Currently, you spend money sending ads to ALL 1,000 people hoping they'll come back and buy something. But only 50 actually purchase. You're wasting money on 950 people who will never buy.

**The Solution**: Use visitor behavior data to identify the 200 people most likely to purchase, then only send ads to them. This could triple your marketing efficiency.

**Our Dataset**: One day's worth of website visitor data showing what people clicked, which pages they visited, and whether they actually bought something.

## Phase 1: Data Understanding (1 day)
**What we're doing**: Getting familiar with our visitor data
**Business Translation**: 
- Count how many visitors we have (like counting customers in a store)
- Check each visitor has a unique ID (no duplicate counting)
- See what percentage actually bought something (our success rate)
- Compare mobile vs desktop visitors (different shopping behaviors)

**Dataset Connection**: We have visitor actions like "added item to basket" and "visited homepage" - these are clues about buying intent.

## Phase 2: Feature Analysis (2 days)
**What we're doing**: Finding patterns in visitor behavior
**Business Translation**:
- Mobile users vs desktop users - who buys more?
- Returning customers vs first-time visitors - conversion differences?
- People who sign in vs guests - purchase rates?
- Which website actions predict actual purchases?

**Dataset Connection**: Our data shows device type (`device_mobile`, `device_computer`), user status (`returning_user`), and actions (`basket_add_detail`, `sign_in`) - we're finding which combinations lead to sales.

## Phase 3: Feature Engineering (1 day)
**What we're doing**: Creating shopping behavior scores
**Business Translation**:
- Engagement Score: How actively did someone browse? (clicking products, viewing details)
- Navigation Depth: How many pages did they explore? (homepage, checkout, delivery info)
- Purchase Intent: Strong buying signals (checked delivery, looked at checkout, added to basket)

**Dataset Connection**: We combine related actions from our data - instead of tracking 24 separate clicks, we group them into meaningful shopping behaviors.

## Phase 4: Modeling (2 days)
**What we're doing**: Building a "likelihood to purchase" calculator
**Business Translation**:
- Train a system to predict: "This visitor has X% chance of buying"
- Test accuracy: Can we correctly identify buyers vs non-buyers?
- Find key factors: What website behaviors matter most?

**Dataset Connection**: We use the `ordered` column (did they buy: yes/no) to teach our system what buyer behavior looks like based on all their website actions.

## Phase 5: Marketing Segmentation (1 day)
**What we're doing**: Grouping visitors by purchase likelihood
**Business Translation**:
- **Hot Leads (70%+ likely)**: Send immediate "complete your purchase" ads
- **Warm Prospects (30-70%)**: Send nurturing emails over time
- **Cold Visitors (<30%)**: Only show general brand awareness (cheaper ads)

**Dataset Connection**: Based on visitor actions (signing in + adding to basket + returning user = high probability), we predict who to target with expensive ads vs cheap ones.

## Phase 6: ROI Calculation (1 day)
**What we're doing**: Calculating money saved
**Business Translation**:
- **Current Cost**: $1000 to advertise to all 1000 visitors
- **New Cost**: $200 to advertise to top 200 prospects
- **Same Sales**: Still reach the 50 people who would buy
- **Savings**: $800 (80% cost reduction) with same results

**Dataset Connection**: Our model identifies the 20% of visitors who generate 80% of purchases, letting us focus marketing budget efficiently.

## Phase 7: Implementation (2 days)
**What we're doing**: Making the system work daily
**Business Translation**:
- Every day, score new visitors based on their behavior
- Export lists of "high-value prospects" to Facebook Ads, Google Ads
- Set up automatic targeting rules
- Create simple dashboard showing daily results

**Dataset Connection**: Turn our one-day analysis into a repeatable system that processes new visitor data automatically.

## Phase 8: Monitoring (Ongoing)
**What we're doing**: Tracking if it's working
**Business Translation**:
- Monitor: Are we still correctly identifying buyers?
- Measure: Is cost-per-customer decreasing?
- Adjust: Update the system weekly as visitor behavior changes
- Report: Show marketing team their improved results

**Dataset Connection**: Compare predictions vs actual purchases daily to ensure our system stays accurate as website and visitor behavior evolves.

## Why This Matters for Learning
**Real Business Impact**: This isn't academic - it's how companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Facebook make billions by showing the right ads to the right people.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks total  
**Tools**: Standard data science tools (Python, Excel-like data processing)  
**Deployment**: Daily automated reports, not complex real-time systems  
**Success Metric**: 30-50% marketing cost reduction by targeting the right customers

**Key Insight**: Small behavioral clues (like checking delivery details) can predict big outcomes (actual purchases). The art is finding these patterns in data and turning them into profitable business actions.
